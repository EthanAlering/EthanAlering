	<p>During the school year I had a really fun time Working hard on school work. My friends and I studied together and I always had someone to helpw ith Hw. My teachers helped me after I had surgery. I had highlights like acing my spanish tests but tough luck with math. I enjoyed coding in acpscp and I had fun working on this final. English was nice and we read cool books. I liked learning about history in the world. and chemistry is ever so fun</p>
